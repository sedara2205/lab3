## Set Up Project: Download the lab_3.zip file and integrate Back4App Parse server keys in AppDelegate.swift.

## Add Camera Feature: In PostViewController, configure UIImagePickerController to allow photo capture. Ensure PostViewController conforms to UIImagePickerControllerDelegate and UINavigationControllerDelegate.

## Handle Image Capture: Implement imagePickerController(_:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:) to get the captured image and set it on previewImageView and pickedImage.

## Update Info.plist: Add Privacy - Camera Usage Description to Info.plist with a description for camera access permission.

## Filter Posts: In FeedViewController, update queryPosts to fetch posts from the last 24 hours and limit to 10 posts.

## Manage User's Last Post Date: In PostViewController, update the lastPostedDate for the current user upon successful post sharing, then test the app to ensure the blur feature works as described.
